A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively
form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element
of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list.

The first and last node of a linked list are known as the head and tail of the
list, respectively. By starting at the head, and moving from one node to another
by following each nodeâ€™s next reference, we can reach the tail of the list. We can
identify the tail as the node having None as its next reference. This process is
commonly known as traversing the linked list. Because the next reference of a
node can be viewed as a link or pointer to another node, the process of traversing
a list is also known as link hopping or pointer hopping.

This code uses the attached CSV file, which contains the info about ALL Airports exists today.
I used the bubble sort algorithm, which is not the best according to Big O notation. 

The time it took on my PC to sort it was approximately one and a half hour. The screenshot attached.
